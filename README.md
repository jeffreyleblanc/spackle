# About Spackle

Spackle is a simple scaffold for local SPA fronted python apps.

It uses:

* Back end:
    * Python
    * [Tornado Web Framework](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
* Front End:
    * [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for building
    * [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/)
    * [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    * and `postcss` and `autoprefixer`

There is a `Makefile` to help with the `spa-src` building.
